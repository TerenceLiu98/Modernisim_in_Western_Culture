## Cubism

1. Introduction
   - What succeeded Expressionism as the next dominant movement in Modernist painting was Cubism. It was **founded by Georges Braque**(1882-1963) and Pablo Picasso(1881-1973) in the first decade of twentieth century.
   - In contrast to Expressionism, Cubism no longer tried to analyze humans' psychology, or to express emotions. What it did was to introduce into Western painting a new understanding of **pictorial representation**
2. Prototype（原型） Cubism(Three phases)
   - Prototype Cubism, Analitical Cubism and Synthetic Cubism
     - *Its original principles were formulated by Braque and Picasso in 1907 and 1908, and it lasted until about 1910*
   - **Prototype** phase of Cubism, was influenced by the art of Paul Cezanne. Inspired by Cezanne, Braque and Picasso began experimenting with geometrical forms.
   - Since the Renaissance, a fundamental principle of Western painting had been the idea that paintings should provide representations of their objects from a single perspective In addition, painters had represented distance and depth by depicting objects that are far from their standpoint as smaller than, and as being located behind, the objects that are closer to that standpoint.
3. Analytical Cubism
   - This was the stage in the development of the movement in which it introduced a new method of pictorial representation into Western painting.	
   - To analyze:
     - to examine; to interpret
     - to break/ to take apart, apart
   - Cubism now did was to bring to Western painting a multiplicity of perspectives. Cubists would try to see an object from many perspectives; This multi-perspectivism
     was a technique of pictorial representation whose invention constituted a revolution in the history of Western painting.
4. Synthetic Cubism
   - Synthetic:
     - to unite Analytical Cubism

- Nietzsche: a freeman is a warrior 

- Anchor means hope $\Rightarrow$ it is not a cross, it is a anchor./ war is a good thing.

## Surrealism

Surrealism became the main movement of modernist painting between the two world ars. 

**It wa influenced strongly by Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis.**

Surrealist painters came to believe that the Id could be a source of creativity and
creative energy. Holding this conviction, they tried to invent a new process of artistic creation.

They endeavorered to suspend the operation of their reason, and to let their works arise freely and directly from the unconscious regions of their psyches—from their Ids. Surrealists, for
example, claimed that images that they used in their paintings had appeared to them spontaneously, without their inventing or designing these images in a rational manner. 

The famous Surrealist, **Salvador Dali**, for instance, explained that he would wake up early, and would then try to stop thinking;
