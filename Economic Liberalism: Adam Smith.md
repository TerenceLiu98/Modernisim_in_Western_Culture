  * ::Free:: trade ( no restrictions on commerce; no tariffs of duties )
  * government step back and let ::individuals:: pursue their own economic self-interests;
  * produce the most efficient, effective and ::equitable:: distribution of economic resources in society

# Political Liberalism: John Stuart Mill
* *On Liberty* ( 1859 ): the “manifesto” of Liberalism

* the retention of liberty was necessary to protect against political tyranny of overzealous rulers

  Society ::force:: the individual to do sth. Because the society ::thinks:: it may be good for the individual.

* **( DEFINITION ):**
  The scope of the individual’s liberty: 
  Harm Principle: 

  > that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of other;   

  > It means that: **The individual** is free to do whatever they want, as long as they ::do not HARM:: other people   

* **(CONTENTS):**
  The individual’s liberty consists of three basic freedoms:
  * freedom of thought ( include that the freedom of expression )
  * freedom of pursuits
  * freedom of association
    **There is a limit of the liberty —— HARM PRINCIPLE**

* ### How to live our lives

  Hannah Arendt-20-century German philosopher:

  ```
  “Hell” is a place where everybody is the same!
  ```

  Individuals should makes themselves more **valuable**
  We should be different; experience our own life!
  ::**Develop our own individuality!!!**::
  Personality; personal characteristics; unique talents; personal interests; unique, individual skills; special passions for/interests in something.

  Diversity makes society progress.
  ::If individual is valuable the society is valuable.:: 



## The ideas of Darwin (Charles Darwin)

- Darwin = the father of evolution: Theory of evolution
  1800-1900 science became much important!

- Method/way of explaining the universe

- **His Works:**

  - The Origin of Species(1859)
  - The Descent of Man(1871)

- **Darwin’s Concept of Evolution**

  - ::Evolution::: the development of species toward a better adaptation to their”conditions of life” and towards a more “advanced” biological “organization.”

  - **Evolution = development in general (nowadays)**

  - Darwins *Evolution=two goals*:(found in the concept)

    - a better adaptation to the environment;
    - a more complex/complicated biology

  - The explanation of Evolution:

    - The Engine of Evolution: Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest

    1. Organisms, belonging to the same species, multiply/procreate/reproduce **very fast**.
    2. Because these organisms procreate **very fast**, nature **does not have enough resources** (food) to support them all.
    3. Because of the scarcity of natural resources, the organisms of the species compete with each other for **the limited resources**—i.e., **they struggle with each other for survival.** 
    4. Within each species, there are organisms that **have advantageous characteristics** that will enable them to **win** the struggle with other organisms of the same species for the limited natural resources.
    5. Thanks to their advantageous characteristics, the organisms that have them will win the struggle for the limited natural resources.
    6. The survivors of the struggle for natural resources, i.e., the organisms with the advantageous characteristics, will produce progeny; they will procreate.
    7. The survivors will pass on their advantageous characteristics to their progeny/descendants.
    8. After many generations, the advantageous characteristics will become prominent within the species of organisms.

    - ::Darwin did not know GENE::

Lamarck = acquired 
Characteristics are inherited

# Liberal Morality:Jeremy Bentham
Philosophy:

1. Moral philosophy ( Ethics )

2. Political philosophy

3. Aesthetics: Beauty, Art

4. Logic

   * He bequeathed his body to the University College London (UCL)

      His theory:	

     * Pleasure = Morality / Pain are immoral
     * “The hedonic Calculus”: Mathematics pleasure
     * 1 Hedon: Unit of Pleasure
     * 2 Dolor: Unit of Pain

   * The individual level: 

     * **the individual should maximise the pleasure and to minimise the pain**	

   * The societal level:

   * **the government should maximise the society’s pleasure and minimise the pain**

 # Nietzsche's Philosophical Method
 *Critical of Western philosophy Something wrong with the ::subject of knowledge of:: western phildphilosophy.*

 1. The subject of knowledge of Western philosophy is not quite human; it is some what inhuman
    *  **Western philosophy is abstract, difficult to understand**
    *  **"pure", "will-less", "painlees", "timelss"**
    *  Godlike mind:
         ::which is located outside of time, feel no desires, is perfect, doesn't feel pains/and emotions/not human::
         **Western philosophy has always been very arogant -talking to us as if it were God.**
    *  Different people hve different perspectvie - "Perspectivism"
      Just like Cublism - Pablo Picasso

 2. View on Christianity
     Criticized Christianity
       * **Christianity makes people lose their energy;--through ::pity !:: Pity depress people**
       * encourages suffering, it gives suffering a purpose/a meaning.
       * Because Christianity promises Heaven.
       * Pity = dangerous to society. Why ?
           ::Because it keeps alive those who are weak; who wold die, without the help of others !! ::

 3. View of the idea of progress

     Nietzsche 's view

     * Progress may not mean things getting better;
     * No: progress is not taking place in his time and society;
     * nietzsche does not like the idea of progress. He rejects it !!!
       The Renaissance = an intellectual revolution; late 14th to early 16th century
       Renaissance = " re-birth "

 4. Views on Darwin
     * Reject the Darwinism

5. Views on Western Moral Philosophy/Ethics
    **Ethics = Moral Philosophy: the brach/part of philosophy that deals with morality.**

6. Nictzsche's Own Ethics

    *  Western moral philosophy  = goes against the life instincts(Western ethics forces people to do somethin that they may not want to do.)
    *  Western ethics go agagainst nature; it is not nature but nurture; try to limit humans, to limit human life
    *  Good = the feeling of power

7. Concept of Freedom


   The free man is a warroior. Warrior = fighter;

   Freedom:
    - Being/remaining who we are/remaining faithful to ourselves;
     - Being independent/different frome others ;
     - Being courageous/brave;
     - Overcoming difficulties;
     - Fighting
       Freedom: the freedom to fight for our causes/ideals; to try to achieve our ideals by all means!
       Harm Princple makes no sense! One has to be prepared to sacrifice other people, including oneself, for one's ideals.
