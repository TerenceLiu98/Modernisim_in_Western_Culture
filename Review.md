# Nietzsche's Philosophical Method

 *Critical of Western philosophy Something wrong with the **subject of knowledge of** western phildphilosophy.*

1. The subject of knowledge of Western philosophy is not quite human; it is some what inhuman

   - **Western philosophy is abstract, difficult to understand**

   - **"pure", "will-less", "painlees", "timeless"**

   - Godlike mind:
     ::which is located outside of time, feel no desires, is perfect, doesn't feel pains/and emotions/not human::
     **Western philosophy has always been very arrogant -talking to us as if it were God.**

   - Different people have different perspective - "Perspectivism"
     Just like Cublism - Pablo Picasso

   - Own up to envy - a big part of life 

     Christianity generally teaches to be feel ashamed of our envious feelings 

     There is nothing wrong with envy, maintained Netzsche so long as we use is as a guide

     to what we really want. He insisted that we must face up to our true desires, put up a heroic fight to huonur them, and only then mourn failure with solemn dignity.

2. View on Christianity
   Criticized Christianity

   - **Christianity makes people lose their energy;--through ::pity !:: Pity depress people**
   - encourages suffering, it gives suffering a purpose/a meaning.
   - Because Christianity promises Heaven.
   - Pity = dangerous to society. Why ?
     **Because it keeps alive those who are weak; who wold die, without the help of others !! **
   - Do't be a Christian - criticise to the Christianity

   Christianity makes people lose their energy;--through **pity !** Pity depress people;

   Christianity for protecting people from their envy.

   **Slave Morality**

   In christianity that Purity weakness became goodness, submission-to-people-one-hates became obedience and, in Nietzsche's phrase, "not-being-able-to-take-revenge" turned into "forgiveness"

   Christianity amounted to a giant machine for bitter denial

3. View of the idea of progress

   Nietzsche 's view

   - Progress may not mean things getting better;
   - No: progress is not taking place in his time and society;
   - nietzsche does not like the idea of progress. He rejects it !!!
     The Renaissance = an intellectual revolution; late 14th to early 16th century
     Renaissance = " re-birth "

4. Views on Darwin

   - Reject the Darwinism

5. Views on Western Moral Philosophy/Ethics
   **Ethics = Moral Philosophy: the brach/part of philosophy that deals with morality.**

6. Nictzsche's Own Ethics

   - Western moral philosophy  = goes against the life instincts(Western ethics forces people to do somethin that they may not want to do.)
   - Western ethics go agagainst nature; it is not nature but nurture; try to limit humans, to limit human life
   - Good = the feeling of power

7. Concept of Freedom

   The free man is a warroior. Warrior = fighter;

   Freedom:

```
- Being/remaining who we are/remaining faithful to ourselves;
 - Being independent/different frome others ;
 - Being courageous/brave;
 - Overcoming difficulties;
 - Fighting
   Freedom: the freedom to fight for our causes/ideals; to try to achieve our ideals by all means!
   Harm Princple makes no sense! One has to be prepared to sacrifice other people, including oneself, for one's ideals.
```

*Some words are created by him: Ego(自我), Id(本我), Superego(超我), The unconscious, THe Oedipus complex (戀母情結）, Libido(性慾), Electra complex(戀父情結）*

**Superego** is Freud's word means consciousness ; it is a result of educational /education may be opposite to ego&ID substitute of parents; Influence of the past **MORALITY** in personality;

He argued:

​	Sexuality = a defining, perhaps the most important, human characteristic.

<center>**The 19th century = The Victorian era**</center>

A Moral period, a period obsessed with morality

​	wPolymorphous(多形態的) perverse sexuality. Extreme sexuality with many forms.

- *The Interpretation of Dreams(1900)* The most important book he wrote. 
  - "An Outline of Psychoanalysis" He said. 



- LIBIDO =Sexuality

  **It is a "Love energy" not only sexuality**; Total quantity of our.

  **LOVE** is a process one person cover (cathexis) another person' libido.

## *The Interpretation of Dreams(1900)*

1. he book actually Freud analyze his own dream;

2. The book actually Freud analyze his own dream;o analyze human dreams. ( He took dreams seriously!) To analyze dreams scientifically; to traditional, folk, popular methods of analyzing dreams

   1. The "symbolic" method

      - It takes the content of a person's dream as a whole, and the tries to discover  its hidden, symbolic meaning.

   2. THe "cipher" method

      - The dream is broken up into its component parts; then, the meaning of each part is dis coverec by consulting a dream book.

   3. Freud's Own Method of Interpreting Dreams

      - Restfull position
      - Give up critical
      - In the condition just  like  we nearly fall asleep

   4. The Dream of Irma's Injection

      1. In Freud's <font color=#0099ff size=3 face="黑体">Real Life:</font>:

         Irma is his patient; she is suffering from a psychological problem. Freud has prescribed a treatment, but Irma is willing to follow it closely.

         Summer comes, and Freud and Irma decide to take abreak from the treatment of Irma's illness.

         Freud goes on a holiday. One, during Freud's holiday, his friend, the doctor Otto, comes to visit Freud. Otto has just seen irma. Freud as Otto how irma is doing. Otto says that Irma is well, but not perfectly healthy. On the night after Otto's visit, Freud has his dream of Irma's injection.

         The <font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">DREAM</font> itself:

         <font color=#0099ff size=3 face="黑体">There is a party at Freud's holiday house. Irma is present; so is Dr. Otto, and also two other doctors: Dr. Leopold and Dr.M.

         Freud asks Irma how she is doing. She says: OK but not healthy. Freud says: the fact that you are still ill is <span style="border-bottom:2px dashed red;">your own fault</span>, because you aren't following the treatment that I prescribed!!!

         Freud then examines Irma; he performs a medical exam of Irma.

         Otto, Leopold, and M also join him and all 4 doctors examine Irma.

         Irma is , indeed, ill. She suffering from an **Infection**. She is not psychological, but physical. Where did the infection come from? It was the result of an unclean injection(a dirty syringe) that was made by <font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">OTTO!!!</font>

         **What is the MEANING of the dream, according to Freud**

         - He did not want to be responsible for her illness;
         - Developed a desire to punish/blame Otto;
         - Feel guilty for Irma.

         **<font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">Dreams are fulfullments of human wishes!!**</font>

         Dreams tells us a lot about human nature. Freud's analysis of dreams shows/reveals a negative picture of human nature/ human beings.
