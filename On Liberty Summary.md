# The background to Modernism
## The idea of Liberalism
## The ideas of Darwin (Charles Darwin)
* Darwin = the father of evolution: Theory of evolution
1800-1900 science became much important!
* Method/way of explaining the universe
* **His Works:**
	* The Origin of Species(1859)
	* The Descent of Man(1871)
* **Darwin’s Concept of Evolution**
	* ::Evolution::: the development of species toward a better adaptation to their”conditions of life” and towards a more “advanced” biological “organization.”
	* **Evolution = development in general (nowadays)**
	* Darwins *Evolution=two goals*:(found in the concept)
		* a better adaptation to the environment;
		* a more complex/complicated biology
	* The explanation of Evolution:
		* The Engine of Evolution: Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest
		1. Organisms, belonging to the same species, multiply/procreate/reproduce **very fast**.
		2. Because these organisms procreate **very fast**, nature **does not have enough resources** (food) to support them all.
		3. Because of the scarcity of natural resources, the organisms of the species compete with each other for **the limited resources**—i.e., **they struggle with each other for survival.** 
		4. Within each species, there are organisms that **have advantageous characteristics** that will enable them to **win** the struggle with other organisms of the same species for the limited natural resources.
		5. Thanks to their advantageous characteristics, the organisms that have them will win the struggle for the limited natural resources.
		6. The survivors of the struggle for natural resources, i.e., the organisms with the advantageous characteristics, will produce progeny; they will procreate.
		7. The survivors will pass on their advantageous characteristics to their progeny/descendants.
		8. After many generations, the advantageous characteristics will become prominent within the species of organisms.
		* ::Darwin did not know GENE::

Lamarck = acquired 
Characteristics are inherited
