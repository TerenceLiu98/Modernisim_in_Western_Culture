   4. The Dream of Irma's Injection

      1. In Freud's <font color=#0099ff size=3 face="黑体">Real Life:</font>:

         Irma is his patient; she is suffering from a psychological problem. Freud has prescribed a treatment, but Irma is willing to follow it closely.

         Summer comes, and Freud and Irma decide to take abreak from the treatment of Irma's illness.

         Freud goes on a holiday. One, during Freud's holiday, his friend, the doctor Otto, comes to visit Freud. Otto has just seen irma. Freud as Otto how irma is doing. Otto says that Irma is well, but not perfectly healthy. On the night after Otto's visit, Freud has his dream of Irma's injection.

         The <font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">DREAM</font> itself:

         <font color=#0099ff size=3 face="黑体">There is a party at Freud's holiday house. Irma is present; so is Dr. Otto, and also two other doctors: Dr. Leopold and Dr.M.

         Freud asks Irma how she is doing. She says: OK but not healthy. Freud says: the fact that you are still ill is <span style="border-bottom:2px dashed red;">your own fault</span>, because you aren't following the treatment that I prescribed!!!

         Freud then examines Irma; he performs a medical exam of Irma.

         Otto, Leopold, and M also join him and all 4 doctors examine Irma.

         Irma is , indeed, ill. She suffering from an **Infection**. She is not psychological, but physical. Where did the infection come from? It was the result of an unclean injection(a dirty syringe) that was made by <font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">OTTO!!!</font>

         **What is the MEANING of the dream, according to Freud**

         * He did not want to be responsible for her illness;
         * Developed a desire to punish/blame Otto;
         * Feel guilty for Irma.

         **<font color=#ff0000 size=3 face="黑体">Dreams are fulfullments of human wishes!!**</font>

         Dreams tells us a lot about human nature. Freud's analysis of dreams shows/reveals a negative picture of human nature/ human beings.
