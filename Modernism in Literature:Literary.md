     * He has been very famous. Fasting has been a popular/fashinable activity, and the hunger artist has been a celebrity.

     * Now , however, fasting is out of fashion. So, everybody has forgotten about the hunger artist.

     * HE hires himself to a circus. THe circus puts a cage for him, close to the circus animals. But,no one pays attention to him; all the workers at the circus forget about him. So, he keeps fastening, and fasting, and fasting. One day, the circus workers remember him. They go to his cage, and dis cover him there. One of the workers enters the cage, and asks him if he is still ther. The hunger artist says that he is still there, and then tells the worker the reason why he has been fasting all his life. And the reason is :HE HAS NOT FOUND ANY FOOD THAT HE LIKES!!!

     * After he says that, he dies. And the circus buries him and puts a young, healthy panther in he's cage. And the panther becomes very popular among the people who go to the circus.

       Religion in modern Western society

       Fasting - a religious ritual in many religions. $\Rightarrow$ 40days

       Religion is desappearing from modern Western society

 2.  The Judgment*

     - Georg Bendemann. 

     - People live under authority/power, and the power limits the people's freedom. The people are oppressed in European society; they are oppressed by <font color=#ff0000>Patriarchy!</font> One has to listen to /obey your father.

       - Patriarchy: male-domination; domination of society by men. A critique of modern Europe's patriarchal society.

     - The psychology of the individual in Europe. A little bit like Expressionism in painting.

       - The story is like a <font color=#ff0000>dream.</font> $\Rightarrow$ Freud's ideas.
       - Freud: Masochism: Enjoying suffering; Oedipus complex: the experience, which you boys have, of wantingto have sex with their mother and to murdern/kill their fathers.
       - **The weakness of the individual; the modern European.**

     - Human relationships: (are all problematic)

       1. Georg and his father: this is tragic relationship, a very destructive one
       2. Georg and his mother: the mother is dead.
       3. Georg and his friend in Russia: Georg feels that he and his friend have grown apart; they are not as close as they used to be; Georg is not completely open with his friend; he is very careful about. what he is writing to his friend in his letter.
       4. Georg and his fiancée : Love is never mentioned by Georg, very likely, are marriage of money/convenience.

       **Human relationships in modern Western society are a disaster.**

       5. The friend in Russia. 

          He is in Russia; he is engaged in some kind of business, but the business is not going. well. He is lonely. He does not have any solid relationship to any people in Russia. At the same time, he cannot come back to his own, home country, because everyone would thinke that he is a failure, who has not succeeded abroad.

          This is a symbol of homelessness! of loneliness! 




Samuel Beckett

​	*Waiting for Godot*

​	*Krapp's Last Tapes*

​	Krapp says "perhaps my best years are gone. When there was a chance of happiness. But I wouldn’t want them back. Not with the fire in me. No I wouldn’t want them back"

* He is a writer living in loneliness.

  * Loneliness is a common experience of the modern individual.

* The individual: What does Beckett have to say about the individual?

  * portrays the modern Western individual in a very negative way! The play is a critique of the modern Western individual.

* Human relationship: How are they protrayed by Beckett?

  * Krapp and his mother: 
  * Krapp and a girl that he hd a relationship with when he was young.
  * Old Krapp an his current girlfriend

  $\Rightarrow$ **Human relationships are disastrous in modern Western society.**





**These writer are very critical to the Western Society, just like Nietzche and Dada.
